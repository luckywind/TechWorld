pos: NoPosition missing or invalid dependency detected while loading class file 'U.class'.
Could not access type T in package pack1,
because it (or its dependencies) are missing. Check your build definition for
missing or conflicting dependencies. (Re-run with `-Ylog-classpath` to see the problematic classpath.)
A full rebuild may help if 'U.class' was compiled against an incompatible version of pack1. ERROR
